 Formats email with data from spreadsheet

Creates an email message for each row in example_email_list.xlsx. Data from each row is used to format the messages. Output is stored in output.txt.

I created this to avoid some of the manual, repetitive work I had to do when setting up user accounts for one of our partners.
